   - Develop a webpage containing useful resources, system documentation, and links.
   - Submission: URL via onQ.

2. **A1 – Conceptual Architecture Analysis**
   - Document the abstract architecture based on existing documentation.
   - Submission: PDF report via onQ, later published online.

3. **A2 – Concrete Architecture Analysis**
   - Analyze the actual implementation and compare it with the conceptual architecture.
   - Submission: ZIP file containing report and project files via onQ, later published online.

4. **A3 – Enhancement Proposal**
   - Propose an enhancement, detailing architectural changes and impact analysis.
   - Submission: PDF report via onQ, later published online.

## Submission Guidelines
- Each deliverable requires a single group submission via onQ.
